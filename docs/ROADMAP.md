# Roadmap

Planned releases aligned with the dual-scope vision in `docs/vision.md`. Updates stay local-first (profile + workspace storage), keep commands unchanged, and avoid introducing new services unless the vision is revised.

## Near-term

### 0.3.0 — polish
- Clearer completion affordance/feedback in the webview plus scoped empty states (Global vs. each project), localized EN/DE with playful variants.
- Auto-delete options for completed todos (delay/fade) surfaced in settings and reflected in UI cues.
- Clarify the Activity Bar entry in README, add screenshots/GIFs, and include marketplace keywords/categories.

### 0.4.0 — workflow enhancers
- Move todos between Global and Project scopes via command/inline action.
- Import/export todos for backup/migration using local files only.

### 0.5.0 — optional structure
- Lightweight grouping/sections within a scope while preserving drag-and-drop ordering and `position` semantics.

## Evaluate later (scope expansion)
- Tags and richer metadata: off-vision unless the scope is widened.
- Cloud sync: non-goal for now; would require a vision update and UX for accounts/conflicts.
